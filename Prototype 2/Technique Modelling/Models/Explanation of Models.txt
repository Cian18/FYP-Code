The models that I have saved are coefficients for linear lines.
They are matrices of the following form:

Model = |A00  A01|
        |A10  A11|
        |A20  A21|
 
 Where we multiply it by:  |1   1   1  ....  1 |
                           |t0  t1  t2 ....  tn|

The result will be a 3Xn matrix where each row is the angle to the horizontal of the Torso, Upper Arm and Lower Arm, respectively. Each column is the coordinate at each timestamp.
