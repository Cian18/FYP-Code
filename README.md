# üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Exercise Technique Analysis

This project was developed across three successive prototypes:

- **Prototype 1**: Analyses bicep curl technique and provides basic feedback.
- **Prototype 2**: Improves the bicep curl analysis with refined classification and feedback logic.
- **Prototype 3**: Extends the approach to analyse barbell squat technique.

Each prototype involves the following core stages:

1. **Classification**
   - Detects the phase of the movement (e.g. concentric, eccentric).
2. **Technique Modelling**
   - Generates ideal joint trajectories for comparison.
3. **Feedback Generation**
   - Compares actual motion to the model and provides human-like qualitative feedback.
  
In **Prototype 1** There is no folder indicating that Feedback generation was done, however, since this section was very simple in the first prototype it was contained in the same folder as "techniqie modelling" because it is just one jupyter notebook cell at the end of the technique modelling code.

In **Prototype 3**, additional steps were introduced:

- **Camera Angle Detection**
  - Automatically identifies whether the video is a side or front view.
- **Angle-Specific Pipelines**
  - Classification, modelling, and feedback stages are handled separately for front and side views.
- **MATLAB Files**
  - The fuzzy inference system design in this prototype was done on MATLAB due to the fuzzy logic toolbox having pre-made machine learning optimisation algorithms, not avaoilable in python.
  - Note that while the design was adone in MATLAB, the trained fuzzy inference systems were then imported into python and converted to skfyzzy systems because I am more comfortable coding in python.
